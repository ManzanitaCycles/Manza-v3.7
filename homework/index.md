You've decided to add a Manzanita to your stable. But before that happens, you'll need to provide some information so that your new bike will fit and ride well.

The links below take you to some Google forms, where you'll input your body and favorite bike dimensions. If you've recently had a professional bike fit, good news, you can likely copy those numbers into the forms.

Fill out the following forms if you're ordering a **hardtail**:

1. [Body dimensions form](https://forms.gle/7YdbgWcz8iGoV1Te8) - You'll need a friend to help you accurately measure your body.
2. [Hardtail dimensions form](https://forms.gle/3Wtz6CGMGTdasrZ2A) - Measure the bike you're currently most comfortable on.
