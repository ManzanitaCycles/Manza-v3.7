This is your chance to get a smooth-riding steel hardtail without the typical wait for a custom Manzanita. All of the profits from the sale will go to Sky Tavern, a non-profit in the Reno / Lake Tahoe area building super fun mountain bike trails that are free to ride for all ages and abilities.

The bike will be on display at the MayDay Festival at Sky Tavern on May 19 from 10 am - 5 pm. But the bike is for sale now and you don't need to be a Reno-area local to purchase it. I'll gladly ship you the bike after the festival.

There is only one of these hardtails available. Get it before it's gone!

~~$4,999~~ **SOLD!**

I'll send an online invoice to the first person who [contacts me](/contact) about purchasing the bike. 

## Geometry

The frame is designed to fit riders from 5'8" to 6'0", depending on body proportions and riding preferences. The seat tube is short enough to allow a 210mm dropper post for saddle heights starting around 720mm. The 430mm chainstay length and 778mm front center offers what I consider to be an ideal weight distribution for climbing and descending traction and manoeuvrability.

## Frame details

The top, down, and seat tubes are heat-treated chromoly tubes specifically designed to take the abuse of riding off-road. Paragon Machine Works supplies the CNC-machined head tube and UDH-compatible dropouts. The seat and chain stays are chromoly tubes custom shaped for this frame. 

You can mount a bottle cage to the seat tube without interfering with the long dropper post thanks to the custom stand-offs. Under the down tube you'll find a 3d-printed housing guide and frame protector.

## Build package

The frame comes dressed with a really nice selection of parts that I would use on my own bikes. When I'm choosing parts for a hardtail I focus on the fork, wheels, and brakes. The Rockshox Pike Ultimate fork, Reserve 30|SL aluminum wheels, and Sram G2 R 4-piston brakes are some of the best parts in their respective categories. Throw on some Maxxis rubber and you've got a reliable shredder.

OneUp Components takes care of the cockpit and dropper post. OneUp continues to produce top-notch parts.

The excellent Sram GX Eagle drivetrain shifts smoothly and reliably. No batteries required.
