Casey came to me asking for something visually similar to the Rivendell Hunquapillar, a classic rigid mountain bike, or klunker, but with many of the modern touches that make it distinctly different from the Hunq. Gone would be the rim brakes, the quill stem, the quirky lugs, and the classic MTB geometry. The extra 'diag tube' had to stay though.

Lucky for me, John Watson of the Radavist recently paid a visit to Casey as he was passing through Nevada on his way home to New Mexico. John was kind enough to share all of his photos he took of the 'Klunquazita'.

Casey did a fine job outfitting this bike. It definitely gets top marks for attention to detail. The mix of silver parts and brass accents is really something special. Casey even did the dirty work of deanodizing and polishing a Wolftooth dropper post. I hope someday a company will produce an all silver dropper post. Even those of us who like classic bike aesthetics still appreciate the function of modern components.
