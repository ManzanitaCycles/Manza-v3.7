These are my favorite types of gravel bikes. A combo of big tires and a dropper post allows you to more comfortably tackle the rough and loose dirt roads in the Sierra Nevada. 

The Sram Eagle mullet setup with the E-thirteen cassette and White Industries crank provides a great gear range: low enough to climb the steeps but high enough to keep a brisk pace on the occasional paved segments.

For this build we designed the bike around the Paul Boxcar stem at 70mm. I like designing gravel bikes with shorter stems. This allows me to make the front end longer to avoid toe overlap and to add some desecending confidence. This isn't a tight and whippy race rig. It's meant to cruise the back roads in comfort.

If you'd like me to make you something similar, feel free to [reach out](/contact).
