Brody chose a very practicle build package for this one with the cherry on top being the Revel wheelset with Onyx hubs. I have an Onyx hub on my full suspension bike and love being able to hear nothing but the tires roll through the dirt. If I were to create a ready-made build package for all future hardtails, it would be almost identicle to the parts on this bike.

It's impossible not to mention how this bike looks. Brody chose Prismatic Universe. It's not one color, it's all the colors all at once!
