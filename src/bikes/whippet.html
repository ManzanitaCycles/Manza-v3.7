    <div class="prose mt-lg stack">
      <p>Designing the Whippet dropouts was a true passion project. My goal was to create a dropout that not only stood out as unique to the Whippet but also ensured perfect alignment for the flat mount brake, worked seamlessly with SRAM's Universal Derailleur Hanger (UDH), and was straightforward for powder coaters to finish. After nearly a year of design and prototyping, I'm thrilled with the final result.</p>
      <p>The Whippet dropouts feature a combination of laser-cut steel plates and bolt-on, CNC-machined, hard-anodized aluminum inserts. The inserts nest into alignment holes cut into the steel plates, acting as shear keys to reduce stress on the bolts that secure the two parts together.</p>
      <p>This design delivers precise alignment for SRAM's UDH on the driveside and the 140/160 flat mount brake on the non-driveside. Proper alignment of the flat mount brake is critical to prevent annoying rotor rub and brake squeal.</p>
      <p>To add a touch of personality, one of the stainless steel washers is laser cut with the Manzanita logo.</p>

      <p>Whippet frames are powder-coated six miles from Manzanita World Headquarters, and the 3M vinyl decals are made by a sign shop conveniently located down the street from the powder coater.

      <p>The frame is available in two color schemes: <strong>Manzanita red with light blue graphics and white with black graphics.</strong></p>
      <p>For an extra $100, you can opt for a custom color scheme. Once you've placed your deposit, I can help you dial in your custom colors.</p>

  <!-- Guides section -->
  <section class="mt-xl divider">
    <h2 class="h1">Custom guides</h2>
    <div class="prose mt-base stack">
      <p>Housing guide design is often treated as an afterthought. Bike frames typically go one of two ways: full internal routing, which can be a maintenance nightmare, or oversized, unattractive external guides held in place by cheap zip ties.</p>
      <p>For the Whippet, I set out to elevate the function and form of the humble housing guide.</p>
      <h3>Smaller bosses</h3>
      {% img "e397cdf4-d905-4037-b547-dc8a9fa14558", "Nearly invisible mounting points for housing guides." %}
      <p>The first step was to create a new attachment point, appropriately sized for the task. Typically, M5 bolts are used to secure housing guides to a frame. But for lightweight housing, an M5 bolt is overkill. It offers far more strength than needed. Look at most suspension forks. Their housing guides are secured with M3 bolts. That's the size I chose for the Whippet's housing guide bosses. A local machine shop produced a small batch of these redesigned bosses.</p>
      <p>The smaller M3 bosses come with another benefit: they're nearly invisible. If you plan to run a wireless drivetrain, your Whippet won't need housing guides on the driveside chainstay. Thanks to the compact size of the M3 bosses, they almost disappear, preserving the sleek, minimalist aesthetic that wireless setups are known for.</p>
      <h3>Friction guides</h3>
      {% img "6c25b0c9-7caf-4287-8bac-244662b4a099", "Friction guides are in place on the chainstay." %}
      <p>Next, I designed bolt-on guides that eliminate the need for zip ties or fussy plastic clips. Inspired by the housing guide on the RockShox SID SL fork, I created the friction guide. These guides are 3D-printed to snugly fit either 4mm derailleur housing or 5mm brake housing along the chainstays. The housing snaps securely into the groove, held in place by the guide's precise fit. No zip ties, no fuss.</p>
      <h3>Frame protection guide</h3>
      {% img "9974b527-8b80-4c37-958f-a19d7120f97d", "Frame protection guide under the downtube." %}
      <p>Finally, I addressed the challenge of routing housing along the downtube. When riding off-road, the front tire flings rocks and debris toward the downtube, especially near the bottom bracket shell. This is an ideal spot to add frame protection while also securing housing.</p>
      <p>The bolt-on frame protection guide combines both functions. It shields the frame from debris and protects the housing, all in one streamlined design. And for added utility, the guide is compatible with standard M5 bolts, allowing you to attach a water bottle cage over it.</p>
      <h3>Dropper post guide</h3>
      {% img "c3be5ea9-25bc-4f2c-8fba-c0c6ce98e841", "Frame protection guide under the downtube." %}
      <p>On the back of the seattube, you'll find a discreet, stainless 3d-printed guide that accepts 4mm housing for running a dropper post.</p>

  <!-- Tire Clearance section -->
  <section class="mt-xl divider">
    <h2 class="h1">Tire clearance</h2>
    <div class="prose mt-base stack">
      <h3>Custom yoke</h3>
      {% img "31169924-2fb8-49b6-892e-ac7482fd01b9", "The Whippet chainstays with 3d printed stainless steel yoke", "mt-lg" %}
      <p>It's not easy to cram a 57mm-wide tire into a gravel bike frame. Between the tire and the chainring, there's not much room for the chainstay to sneak through. That's where yokes can help.</p>
      <p>For years, I've relied on off-the-shelf yokes that work well but tend to be quite heavy. With the Whippet, I wanted something better.</p>
      <p>The yoke I designed is 3D-printed in stainless steel, featuring a hollow construction with thicker walls where it narrows to clear the tire and chainring. It transitions from a 19mm diameter where it connects to the chainstay to a 26x20mm oval at the bottom bracket shell.</p>
      <p>On the non-drive side, the chainstay simply bends around the tire with no dimpling required. The round tube maintains its torsional and lateral stiffness, ensuring a solid pedaling platform. Excessive manipulation of chainstays can compromise their integrity over time, increasing the risk of cracking depending on the fabricator's skill.</p>
      <h3>Mud clearance</h3>
      {% img "2952a6e0-1045-425b-a383-4d4e681ce410", "The bent seattube provides tire and mud clearance." %}
      <p>On most frame sizes, the seat tube is bent in-house to provide adequate tire clearance, leaving about a 1/2-inch gap between the tire and the tube. This reduces the likelihood of mud buildup. That's also why the frame has no bridges between the seatstays and chainstays. Bridges are simply another spot to collect mud.</p>

      <p>When searching for the right fork to pair with the Whippet frame, I wanted something that was lightweight, that had clearance for 700x57 tires, and that had mounts for bikepacking trips.</p>

      <summary>What is the warranty?</summary>
      <div>
        <p>I use only the best tubing and raw materials for making your frame, and I stand by my work. If you are the original owner, Manzanita Cycles offers a lifetime warranty on all Manzanita-made products that fail due to a materials or manufacturing defect.</p>
        <p>If you crash, abuse, modify, or damage your Manzanita product, or if you install parts incorrectly, use incompatible parts, or fail to do proper maintenance on your bike, then it will no longer be covered by the warranty. Any paint and graphics are also not covered.</p>
        <p>If you have a problem with a component not made by Manzanita Cycles, it's best to contact the component manufacturer for support. However, if you're having trouble getting traction, let me know and I'll try to help out.</p>

      <summary>Can I run 650b wheels?</summary>
      <div>
        <p>
          The three smallest frame sizes are designed around 650b wheels. All other
          sizes are designed around 700c wheels. If you run 650b wheels on the
          larger frame sizes your bottom bracket will drop around 19mm. That
          may cause frequent pedal strikes riding off road or when trying to pedal when cornering. Therefore, it's
          not recommended.

      <div>
        <p>For sizes M1 to M3 that use 650b wheels, it's recommended to go no smaller than 42mm. For the larger sizes, it's recommended to go no smaller than 40mm. Remember though that your pedals will be closer to the ground running the minimum recommended tire sizes. Be more thoughtful when pedaling in corners or riding singletrack.</p>

      <summary>What's the max weight I can carry on a rear rack?</summary>
      <div>
        <p>
          The frame will get wiggly if you try to add too much weight on a rear rack. I'd
          recommend carrying no more than 8lbs, including the weight of the
          rack.

          The Seido MGV fork can carry a max load of 6.6lbs using a 2-bolt
          cage, 9.9lbs using a 3-bolt cage, 44lbs for a lowrider rack with 4
          mounting points, and 22lbs for a rack with 3 mounting points.

      <summary>How many headset spacers can I use?</summary>
      <div>
        <p>Seido limits the total headset spacer stack below the stem to 35mm from the top of the upper bearing. The top cap of the headset that comes with the frame is 16mm tall. <strong>So you have 19mm of room for additional spacers.</strong></p>
        <p>Additionally, Seido requires that you <strong>leave 5mm of steerer tube above the stem</strong>. Your Whippet will come with Seido's installation instructions. Please refer to those when cutting your steerer tube.</p>
        <p>Frame size M8 is limited to a 10mm spacer stack because the frame maxes out the fork's steerer tube length. This limitation is factored into the Frame Fit Calculator above.</p>

      <summary>Can I run a suspension fork on this frame?</summary>
      <div>
        <p>Most gravel suspension forks with 30mm-40mm of travel will work. The
          taller fork length will slacken the seattube and headtube
          angles a bit, but not enough to dramatically change how the bike
          handles.</p>

        I don't want to run a carbon fork. Can you make me a steel fork

      <div>
        <p>
          The Whippet is designed specifically for the Seido MGV carbon fork
          with its tapered steerer. I think a large headtube and a skinny
          steel fork clash. But I'm happy to make you a bike similar to the
          Whippet with a skinny headtube and a matching steel fork. See the
          <a href="/bikes/custom/">custom option</a>.

          The Whippet is designed to be easy to maintain. All lines run
          externally along the downtube with a port in the seattube for
          running a dropper post. If you want a bike with full
          internal lines, I'm happy to make you a
          <a href="/bikes/custom/">custom bike</a> instead.

      <summary>Is shipping included in the price?</summary>
      <div>
        <p>I typically use UPS to ship your bike with insurance to cover its replacement in case of theft or damage.
          Shipping to a US destination starts at <strong>{{ pricing.optionShippingBase }}</strong> for a frame.
          Framesets or complete bikes will be more.</p>
        <p>I'm also happy to ship to international destinations. But please note that shipping fees, import fees, and import taxes can get very expensive.</p>
        <p>You can also pick up the bike from Manzanita Cycles World Headquarters if you live near Reno.</p>
