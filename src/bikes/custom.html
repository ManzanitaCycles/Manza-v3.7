                    <li>
                        <p>If after our initial conversation, you'd like to have a Manzanita in your life, you'll pay a non-refundable deposit. You've now committed to the build, and I'll add you to the build schedule.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Once added to the schedule, it's time for some homework. You'll receive links to some online
                            forms to record your body and bike measurements and to list the components you'd like to use for
                            the build. This information will help me design your bike for the proper clearances and the
                            right fit. It's at this point that you'll want to consider getting a professional fit. That way
                            we can be confident that the contact points—hands, butt, feet—are where they should be to
                            provide a comfortable and efficient ride.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Before your scheduled build time, we'll discuss all of the details that will make your bike
                            unique. We'll talk ride characteristics, geometry, riding style, frame options, paint colors,
                            fit, and component selection. Soon after, I'll provide a CAD drawing of your frame and a quote
                            for the frame and components package. We can go back and forth at this point until you're happy.
                            After approving the design, you'll pay 50% of the balance for the frame and components package.

                    <li>
                        <p>Once the bike returns from paint, you'll pay the remaining balance. Your new ride will then be
                            carefully wrapped in protective packing material and sent to you fully insured. In an effort to
                            reduce waste, your bike will likely arrive in a recycled cardboard box filled with recycled
                            packing material.</p>

                <p>The base price includes a single color powder coat with vinyl decals. There are probably thousands of powder colors to choose from. I can help you narrow down the search.</p>
                <p>If you're looking for a fancier finish, I can send the frame to a professional bike finisher in Colorado. The cost and turnaround time will increase with this option, but make no mistake, it'll be worth it.</p>

            <div>
                <p>You get a frame with custom geometry that's tailored to your height, weight, and riding preferences. Most additional braze-ons for things like water bottle cages, cargo cages, and framebag and rack mounts are included. Also included are dynamo lighting and Di2 ports and tapered head tubes.

                <p>I prefer to focus on making you the best frame and fork possible. There are several professional wheel
                    builders I can recommend. Tubus and Nitto make the best touring and randonneuring racks. I regularly use
                    those racks to place rack mounts. And we can always paint your stem to match the frame if you want that
                    fully integrated look.</p>

            <div>
                <p>I use only the best tubing and raw materials for making your frame, and I stand by my work. If you are the original owner, Manzanita Cycles offers a lifetime warranty on all Manzanita-made products that fail due to a materials or manufacturing defect.</p>
                <p>If you crash, abuse, modify, or damage your Manzanita product, or if you install parts incorrectly, use incompatible parts, or fail to do proper maintenance on your bike, then it will no longer be covered by the warranty. Any paint and graphics are also not covered.</p>
                <p>If you have a problem with a component not made by Manzanita Cycles, it's best to contact the component manufacturer for support. However, if you're having trouble getting traction, let me know and I'll try to help out.</p>

        <details>
            <summary>Is shipping included in the price?</summary>
            <div>
                <p>I typically use UPS to ship your bike with insurance to cover its replacement in case of theft or damage.
                    Shipping to a US destination starts at <strong>{{ pricing.optionShippingBase }}</strong> for a frame.
                    Framesets or complete bikes will be more.</p>
                <p>I'm also happy to ship to international destinations. But please note that shipping fees, import fees, and import taxes can get very expensive.</p>
                <p>You can also pick up the bike from Manzanita Cycles World Headquarters if you live near Reno.</p>
